          In the *ngFor directive,
           there are several changes compared to previous versions.
            In the Angular versions we are familiar with, 
            we used the *ngFor directive by specifying the variable we
             want to iterate over and the current variable of the cycle; 
             optionally, we could include the index to know
              the position of the elements.
